Types of selectors
There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which type of selector you might need will help you to find the right tool for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the different groups of selectors in more detail.

Type, class, and ID selectors
This group includes selectors that target an HTML element such as an <h1>.

h1 { }
It also includes selectors which target a class:

.box { }
or, an ID:

#unique { }
Attribute selectors
This group of selectors gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element:

a[title] { }
Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:

a[href="https://example.com"] { }
